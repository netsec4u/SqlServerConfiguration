# SqlServerConfiguration

## Description

This module contains functions to configure SQL Server.

## Support

This module has extensively been used within PowerShell on Windows connected to SQL Server 2012 to 2022 on Windows.  Limited testing has been performed within a PowerShell running on non-Windows operating systems or SQL Server on Linux.  Most functions should work as expected; however, I expect some issues to exist for functions that interact with the file system.
